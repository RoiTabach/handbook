<Accordion title="What permissions Elementary requires?">

The CLI needs to have permissions to access the `profiles.yml` file with the relevant profile,
and network access to the data warehouse.

Also, in the `elementary` profile, the credentials should have permissions to:
- Read all project schemas
- Write to the elementary schema

On your dbt project, make sure that Elementary dbt package can:
- Read all project schemas
- Write to the elementary and elementary tests schemas
- Create schemas (alternatively, you can create the elementary schemas in advance)
