<Accordion title="What schemas Elementary adds? What is '__tests' schema?">

The schemas structure we recommend is:

- Your schemas
- Elementary models schema - The schema name is configured under your `dbt_project.yml`.
- Elementary temp test results schema - The Elementary schema name with `__test` suffix.


We recommend configuring a dedicated schema for the Elementary models using the [dbt custom schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas) option.
Here is an example configuration, that creates a schema with the suffix '_elementary' for elementary models:
```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  elementary:
    +schema: elementary
```

Also, Elementary creates a schema to store temp tables with results of elementary anomaly detection tests.
As some users have hundreds of Elementary tests, we didn't want tons of small tables to be created in the Elementary schema.
These results are later merged to the incremental tables in the main elementary schema.

You may change the suffix of the tests schema using a var:
```yml dbt_project.yml
vars:
  tests_schema_name: '_test_results'
```
