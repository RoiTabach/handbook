These are details on how we currently operate.

### Company cadence

- **Daily standup**

  We sync daily on Zoom, at 10AM Israel time. Each team member writes his updates before the sync, and these are shared on slack under #daily-su. If for some reason you can’t attend, make sure to share a written update as well.
  We are currently evaluating [Spinach](https://spinach.io/).

- **All hands**

  In all hands sessions we talk about anything we feel is strategic and is worth discussing live. This is also where the founders share their focus and the slides from board meetings. The format usually include our new learning, and what we should try to learn next.
  These meetings are scheduled ad-hock when needed or around board meetings.


- **Sprints**

  We currently work in 2 weeks sprints.

### Where we work

You can work wherever works for you. We have an [office in Tel Aviv](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Elementary+Data/@32.0712195,34.7858734,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x151d4bfcd4a6355f:0xd2033f4b15615722!8m2!3d32.071215!4d34.7903581!16s%2Fg%2F11tjw5tvdr), with the best [coffee machine](https://international.lamarzocco.com/en/machine/linea-mini/) we were able to fit in the kitchen.
It’s best if on days you work from home you notify on Slack the night before or when you wake up, to prevent a situation where someone is alone in the office and didn’t expect to be.
